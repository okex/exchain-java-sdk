## OKExChain Java SDK

The OKChain Java SDK is a lightweight Java library to interact with OKChain. 

### 1.Components

- src - the functions which could be invoked to interact with OKChain are contained in class `OKChainRPCClientImpl` of package `com.okchain.client.impl`. 
- test - it seems like a set of examples to show how to use the functions mentioned above. The developers could design their code refering to the test functions of class `OKChainRPCClientImplTest` in package `com.okchain.client` in detail.

There are some function modules in path `src` as well :

- common - network communications by RPC；

- crypto - related with the account info and address info of OKChain；
- encoding - the implementation of go-amino in Java;
- proto - the base of amino with protobuf3;
- transaction - how to build an available transaction for OKChain;
- types -  all the message types used in Java SDK;

### 2.Installation

### 5.Contributing

No doubt that it's admirable to make contributions to OKChain Java SDK. You can provide your code as long as you have tested it with a local client and your unit test showed its validity.
