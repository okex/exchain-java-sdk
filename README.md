## OKExChain Java SDK

The OKExChain Java SDK is a lightweight Java library to interact with OKExChain. 

### 1.Components

- src - the functions which could be invoked to interact with OKEXChain are contained in class `OKEXChainRPCClientImpl` of package `com.okexchain.client.impl`. 
- test - it seems like a set of examples to show how to use the functions mentioned above. The developers could design their code refering to the test functions of class `OKEXChainRPCClientImplTest` in package `com.okexchain.client` in detail.

There are some function modules in path `src` as well :

- common - network communications by RPC；

- crypto - related with the account info and address info of OKEXChain；
- encoding - the implementation of go-amino in Java;
- proto - the base of amino with protobuf3;
- transaction - how to build an available transaction for OKEXChain;
- types -  all the message types used in Java SDK;
